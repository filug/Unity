{"name":"Unity","tagline":"Simple Unit Testing for C","body":"### Unity\r\n\r\n[Unity] is very good (and small) unit test framework developed by [ThrowTheSwitch.org].\r\nTogether with another one tool from [ThrowTheSwitch.org] i.e. [CMock] any unit tests can be developed with minimal effort.\r\n\r\n### CMake\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, by default, [Unity] is not integrated with [CMake]. Additionally some additional effort is needed to:\r\n\r\n - generate _runner_ based on test definition,\r\n - run unit tests and generate test results,\r\n - summarize all test cases. \r\n\r\nMost of the work can be automated and [here](https://github.com/filug/Unity) [CMake] module (with full [Unity] project) is available.\r\n\r\n#### Usage\r\n\r\nTo add support for [Unity] tests please include [unity.cmake] file like presented below\r\n\r\n    include(3rdParty/Unity/cmake/unity.cmake)\r\n\r\nAfter that each particular [Unity] test can be added by the following command\r\n\r\n    unity_add_test(name src1 [src2...])\r\n\r\n> **Note:** It is important to notice that for the first source file (_src1_ here) test runner will be generated.\r\n\r\nIf needed [Unity] test can be linked with any static library by the following command\r\n\r\n    unity_link_libraries(name lib1 [lib2...])\r\n\r\nAll [Unity] tests are executed when `utest` target is invoked.\r\n\r\n#### How it works\r\n\r\nEach time when `unity_add_test` is called the first file is processed by [generate_test_runner.rb] and customized _test runner_ is generated.\r\n\r\nIn the next step all sources files (from `unity_add_test` call + generated _test runner_) and libraries (added via `unity_link_libraries` command) are used to produce binary test application.\r\n\r\nFinally test application is executed and output is stored in `*.testresults` file.\r\n\r\n---- \r\nWhen all [Unity] tests were executed [unity_test_summary.rb] is used to produce [Unity] test summary.\r\n\r\n#### Example\r\n\r\n    $ make utest\r\n    [ 15%] Built target foomock\r\n    [ 23%] Built target cexception\r\n    [ 30%] Built target unity\r\n    [ 53%] Built target utest.foo-test-STATIC\r\n    [ 61%] Built target utest.foo-test-STATIC.executor\r\n    [ 84%] Built target utest.playground\r\n    [ 92%] Built target utest.playground.executor\r\n    [100%] Show Unity tests summary\r\n    \r\n    --------------------------\r\n    OVERALL UNITY TEST SUMMARY\r\n    --------------------------\r\n    2 TOTAL TESTS 0 TOTAL FAILURES 0 IGNORED\r\n    \r\n    [100%] Built target utest\r\n\r\n\r\n[Unity]: http://www.throwtheswitch.org/unity \r\n[ThrowTheSwitch.org]: http://www.throwtheswitch.org\r\n[CMock]: http://www.throwtheswitch.org/cmock\r\n[CMake]: https://cmake.org\r\n[unity.cmake]: https://github.com/filug/Unity/blob/master/cmake/unity.cmake\r\n[generate_test_runner.rb]: https://github.com/filug/Unity/blob/master/auto/generate_test_runner.rb\r\n[unity_test_summary.rb]: https://github.com/filug/Unity/blob/master/auto/unity_test_summary.rb\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
